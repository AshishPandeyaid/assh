## Overview

A *transparent wrapper* that adds **regex**, **aliases**, **gateways**, **includes**, **dynamic hostnames** to **SSH**.

**Advanced SSH config** is wrapped in [lib-ssh](https://www.libssh.org) as a [ProxyCommand](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Proxies_and_Jump_Hosts#ProxyCommand_with_Netcat), it means that it works seamlessly with:

* [ssh](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&sektion=1)
* [scp](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp&sektion=1)
* [rsync](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/rsync1.html)
* [git](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/)
* Desktop applications depending on `lib-ssh` or `ssh` (i.e: [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com), [Atom.io](https://atom.io), [SSH Tunnel Manager](http://projects.tynsoe.org/fr/stm/))

## Features

### Configuration features

* **regex** support
* **aliases** `gate` -> `gate.domain.tld`
* **gateways** -> transparent ssh connection chaining
* **includes**: split configuration in multiple files
* **local command execution**: finally the reverse of **RemoteCommand**
* **templates**: equivalent to host but you can't connect directly to a template, perfect for inheritance
* **inheritance**: make hosts inherits from host hosts or templates
* **variable expansion**: resolve variables from environment
* **smart proxycommand**: RAW tcp connection when possible with `netcat` and `socat` as default fallbacks

### Using Gateway from command line

Connect to `hosta` using `hostb` as gateway.

```console
$ ssh hosta/hostb
user@hosta $
```

Equivalent to `ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh hostb nc %h %p" hosta`

---

Connect to `host` using `hostb` as a gateway using `hostc` as a gateway.

```console
$ ssh hosta/hostb/hostc
user@hosta $
```

Equivalent to `ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -o ProxyCommand='ssh hostc nc %h %p' hostb nc %h %p" hosta`

### Under the hood features

* Automatically regenerates `~/.ssh/config` file when needed
* Inspect parent process to determine log level (if you use `ssh -vv`, **assh** will automatically be ran in debug mode)
* Automatically creates `ControlPath` directories so you can use *slashes* in your `ControlPath` option

## Configuration

The `~/.ssh/config` file is now managed by `assh`, take care to keep a backup your `~/.ssh/config` file.

`~/.ssh/assh.yml` is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) file containing:

* an `hosts` dictionary containing multiple *HOST* definitions
* a `defaults` section containing global flags
* and an `includes` section containing path to other configuration files

```yaml
hosts:

  homer:
    # ssh homer ->  ssh 1.2.3.4 -p 2222 -u robert
    HostName: 1.2.3.4
    User: robert
    Port: 2222

  bart:
    # ssh bart ->   ssh 5.6.7.8 -u bart           <- direct access

    HostName: 5.6.7.8
    User: bart
    Gateways:
    - direct                   # tries a direct access first
    - homer                    # fallback on homer gateway

  maggie:
    # ssh maggie ->   ssh 5.6.7.8 -u maggie       <- direct access

[Full commits list](https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/compare/be4fea1632b1e9f8aa60585187338777baaf1210...v2.0.0)

### [v1](https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/tree/v1.1.0) (2015-07-22)

* Last Python version

### [POC](https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/commit/550f86c225d30292728ad24bc883b6d3a3e3f1b1) (2010-08-26)

* First Python version (POC)

## Docker

Experimental: `assh` may run in Docker, however you will have limitations:

* The `assh` containers does not have any binaries except `assh`, you can't use `ProxyCommand`, `ResolveCommand`...
* Docker may run on another host, `ssh localhost` will ssh to Docker host

```console
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.ssh:/.ssh moul/assh --help
```

`assh` in Docker is slower and has more limitations, but it may be useful for testing or if you plan to use a Docker host as a remote Gateway

## Alternative version

* [v1](https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/tree/v1) (2009-2015) - The original implementation. It worked quite well, but was a lot slower, less portable, harder to install for the user and harder to work on to develop new features and fix bugs
